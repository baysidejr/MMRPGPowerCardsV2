They start in the same space as the character and instantly move into any open space around them, up to 2 spaces away, during which time the character can swap places with any of the duplicates. If the character is duplicating themselves, the character’s player should secretly record which one is the actual character.

The duplicates can move up to 10 spaces away from the character, and they can pretend to attack (and miss) opponents. Any attack that hits a duplicate instantly removes it. If the character successfully attacks someone or does something else to make the truth evident, the illusion ends.

Effect: The character can communicate telepathically with one machine at a time, and they must have met or seen the machine before. The communication can be verbal, visual or even more complex, such as imparting location information. There is no limit to the distance of the communication, as long as the character and the machine are in the same dimension.

Simple machines do not have much to offer in the way of conversation, but they are also generally compliant with requests. Complex machines—like computers, smartphones and other electronics—are also often compliant, but if they are secured in any way, they usually refuse to communicate with strangers. A Logic check can get the character past such security, and the Narrator should set the target number according to the strength of the security.

Macrodimensional Travel
The character outgrows the universe!

Power Set: Resize

Cost: 15 Focus

Effect: The character can grow enough to travel into the Macroverse, the Overspace or other dimensions of enlarged space. They can return to their normal size at will.

Note that this is something that most characters would rarely want to do, as it removes them entirely from their regular universe and places them in a dimension in which the rules of time and space work differently. An hour in the Macroverse, for example, is roughly equivalent to a month in a regular universe. A trip to the Overspace is too overwhelming for most minds to handle.

Duration: Instant

Cost: 15 Focus

Effect: The character can shrink enough to travel into subatomic realms. They can return to their normal size at will.

Note that this is something that most characters would rarely want to do, as it removes them entirely from their regular universe and places them in a dimension in which the rules of time and space work differently. The Underspace, for example, might make a fine place to hide, but there’s little else of interest there.

If a target is shattered by this power, they can recover, but they come back in one of two ways. Either they are cleansed of their sins and ready to make a new start with a clean slate, or their emotions are drained from them permanently. How this works in each case is up to the Narrator.

If a person is inside something when they stop phasing, they are automatically pushed out of it but take damage from the disruption equal to a standard action check. The damage multiplier is 1 for every space they must move to reach a clear area. If this kills them, their body is trapped inside the material they were phased into.

On a Fantastic success, it inflicts regular Health damage and regular Focus damage instead.

The character controls the vehicle by will, as long as it is within 20 spaces times the character’s rank. They use their Ego for all checks to operate it, and they get an edge on all such checks.
